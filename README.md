## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3: Grid, Flexbox
- Preprocessors: [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

Practiced with creating a brand new React project and combine it with Sass preprocessor. Also used [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) package for adding conditional classes to components and [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to deploy to Github from a command line.
